        Just a CSE student with a passion for coding and a love for exploring
        new technologies. I enjoy working on projects that challenge my skills
        and push me to learn more. Always eager to collaborate with others and
        contribute to exciting projects. When I'm not coding, you'll probably
        find me geeking out over tech trends, brainstorming my next project, or
        playing football mostly ;)
